>A chart repository for the Kubernetes package manager Helm.

## Project Status

As of [PR #75](https://github.com/t3n/helm-charts/pull/75) we dropped support for Helm v2 and switched to Helm Chart apiVersion v2. We also switched labels to [Recommended Labels](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/common-labels/). A detailed introduction on how to migrate without downtime can be found [here](LABEL.md)

This project is still under active development, so you might run into [issues](https://github.com/t3n/helm-charts/issues). If you do, please don't be shy about letting us know, or better yet, contribute a fix or feature.
We will also add more charts over time, so keep an eye on this repository.

## Background

This repository contains charts to deploy Neos & Flow Applications for Kubernetes Helm. Charts are curated application definitions for Kubernetes Helm. For more information about installing and using Helm, see its
[README.md](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm/tree/master/README.md). To get a quick introduction to charts see this [chart guide](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts/).

## Install

To add the t3n charts for your local client, run `helm repo add`:
```
$ helm repo add t3n https://storage.googleapis.com/t3n-helm-charts
"t3n" has been added to your repositories
```

## Usage

You can then run `helm search repo t3n` to see available charts. To install a chart just run `helm install t3n/<chart>`.

For more information on using Helm, refer to the [Helm's documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/).
